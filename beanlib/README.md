This is an unofficial SDK for the [Punch Through Design Bean][1]. The library allows for communication with the bean and control its various functions.

### Getting started ###

Make sure your beans are running the latest firmware!

Add the library as a dependency to your project. When using Android Studio and Gradle it's as easy as adding this dependency:


```
#!groovy

compile 'nl.littlerobots.bean:beanlib:0.9.2'
```

## Examples ##

### Scanning for beans ###

Use the `BeanManager` singleton to scan for available beans like this:

```
#!java
// create a listener
BeanDiscoveryListener listener = ...;
// Assuming "this" is an activity or service:
BeanManager.getInstance().startDiscovery(listener);

```
When beans are found, the `onBeanDiscovered` will be fired in your listener.

### Connecting and interacting with the bean ###
Once you got hold of a bean, you can connect to it like this:

```
#!java
// create a listener, it's onConnected will be called when the bean is connected
BeanListener myBeanListener = ...;
myBean.connect(this, myBeanListener);

// after the connection is instantiated, briefly flash the led:
myBean.setLed(255, 0, 0);
myBean.setLed(0, 0, 0);

// reading things takes a callback:
myBean.readSketchMetaData(new Callback<SketchMetaData>() {
                    @Override
                    public void onResult(SketchMetaData result) {
                        Log.i(TAG, "Running sketch "+result);
                    }
                });

// when you're done, don't forget to disconnect
myBean.disconnect();
```
